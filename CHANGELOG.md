## [1.3.3] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed

- **`reeboot --version` reported `0.0.1`** — CLI was hardcoding the version string; now reads dynamically from `package.json`
- **WhatsApp wizard: baileys logs flood terminal and wizard never advances** — the linking socket was left open after `onSuccess`, causing baileys to keep printing history-sync and session-write logs to stdout. The socket is now closed (500ms after `connection: 'open'`) before `onSuccess` is called, and baileys logging is silenced via pino `level: 'silent'` during the wizard flow.
- **WhatsApp linking: `ENOENT` on session files after successful QR scan** — the wizard was writing auth to a temp directory then renaming it to the permanent location in `onSuccess`. Baileys continues writing session files (Signal protocol sessions, pre-keys) well after `connection: 'open'` fires, causing `ENOENT` on those writes. Fixed by writing directly to the permanent auth directory from the start — no temp dir, no rename.
- **Scheduler crash on start: `require is not defined`** — `src/db/schema.ts` was using `require('cron-parser')` inside an ESM module. Converted to a top-level ESM import.
- **`cron-parser` named export error** — `cron-parser` v4 is a CJS module; its `parseExpression` function is only accessible via the default export. Fixed import from `import { parseExpression }` to `import cronParser from 'cron-parser'`.

### Added

- **`npm run test:run`** — single-pass vitest run (no watch); useful in CI and as a component of the quality check
- **`npm run check`** — full quality gate: `build` then `test:run`. Run this before publishing.
- **Post-build smoke tests** (`tests/smoke.test.ts`) — 10 tests that import compiled `dist/` modules directly and verify export shapes. Catches ESM/CJS import errors, `require()`-in-ESM, and missing named exports that TypeScript and unit tests both miss (because unit tests mock their dependencies). Covers: `db/schema.js`, `scheduler.js`, `channels/whatsapp.js`, `channels/signal.js`, `server.js`, `channels/interface.js`.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed

- **WhatsApp device linking hangs after QR scan** — `linkWhatsAppDevice` now reconnects automatically on stream error 515 (`restartRequired`), which WhatsApp sends as a normal part of the post-pairing handshake. Previously the function had no reconnect logic and would hit the 2-minute timeout instead of completing the link.

---

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed

- **Scheduler init crash** — stale `dist/scheduler.js` was importing `node-cron` (removed in 1.3.0 in favour of the poll-loop) causing `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on startup; fixed by rebuilding from updated source
- **TypeScript build error in `src/index.ts`** — accidental `import type { Prompter }` from test helper (`tests/helpers/fake-prompter.ts`) instead of `src/wizard/prompter.ts`; caused `rootDir` violation and blocked `tsc`
- **WhatsApp timeout: `sock.end()` arity** — baileys 6.7.21 requires `end(error: Error | undefined)`; calling it with no arguments caused a TypeScript error (`Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added

**Setup Wizard UX**
- Revamped interactive setup wizard with dedicated steps: provider selection, agent name, channel linking, and web search backend
- First-run entrypoint — wizard launches automatically when no config exists, starts agent on completion
- `reeboot setup` re-runs the wizard and asks before overwriting existing config
- Support for 8 AI providers in wizard (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Groq, Mistral, xAI, OpenRouter, Ollama)
- Inline QR code display during channel linking (WhatsApp and Signal) within the wizard
- Ollama model list loaded dynamically from local Ollama instance during setup

**Scheduler Upgrade**
- Natural language schedule parsing — `"every 5m"`, `"daily at 9am"`, `"every monday"`, etc.
- Task run log with per-task execution history
- Task poll loop — scheduler continuously checks for due tasks
- `reeboot tasks due` command — shows upcoming scheduled tasks
- Task management tools exposed to the agent (`schedule_task`, `cancel_task`, `list_tasks`, `pause_task`, `resume_task`)

**Proactive Agent**
- System heartbeat — fires at a configurable interval, dispatches a task snapshot prompt to the agent; silent when nothing to do
- In-session `timer` tool — non-blocking one-shot wait; agent can set a timer and be woken up after delay
- In-session `heartbeat` tool — periodic non-blocking wake-up within a session (`start`, `stop`, `status`)
- Sleep interceptor extension — blocks `sleep` when it is the sole or last command in a bash chain, redirects agent to use `timer` instead

**Web Search Extension**
- `web_search` tool with 7 pluggable backends: DuckDuckGo (zero config), Brave, Tavily, Serper, Exa, SearXNG (self-hosted), none
- `fetch_url` tool — always available; fetches any URL and returns clean readable text (Readability + HTML-strip fallback)
- Automatic fallback to DuckDuckGo when configured backend is unreachable at startup
- API key support via environment variables (`BRAVE_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `SERPER_API_KEY`, `EXA_API_KEY`) or config

**Skill Manager Extension**
- `load_skill`, `unload_skill`, `list_available_skills` tools exposed to the agent
- Agent can load/unload skills on demand with optional TTL
- `reeboot skills list` — browse all bundled skills
- `reeboot skills update` — pull extended skill catalog (coming soon)

**Bundled Skills (15)**
- `github` — issues, PRs, releases, Actions, code search (requires `gh` CLI)
- `gmail` — search, read, send, draft, labels, attachments (requires `gmcli` + GCP OAuth)
- `gcal` — list, create, update, delete calendar events (requires `gccli` + GCP OAuth)
- `gdrive` — list, read, upload, search Drive files (requires `gdcli` + GCP OAuth)
- `notion` — pages, databases, blocks, search (`NOTION_API_KEY`)
- `slack` — send messages, list channels, thread replies (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`)
- `linear` — issues, projects, teams, cycles (`LINEAR_API_KEY`)
- `hubspot` — contacts, deals, companies, pipelines (`HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN`)
- `postgres` — query, inspect schema, run statements (`psql` + `DATABASE_URL`)
- `sqlite` — query, inspect tables, run statements (`sqlite3` + `DATABASE_PATH`)
- `docker` — containers, images, compose stacks (`docker` CLI)
- `files` — read, write, search local filesystem
- `reeboot-tasks` — schedule, list, pause, cancel own tasks
- `web-research` — structured multi-query web research
- `send-message` — send a message back to the originating channel

**Docker & CI/CD**
- Official Docker container image (`reeboot/reeboot`) with `Dockerfile` and `entrypoint.sh`
- GitHub Actions CI workflow — lint, test, build, publish to npm and Docker Hub on `v*` tags
- Ollama model templates (`templates/models-ollama.json`)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- Signal **json-rpc transport mode** — recommended over polling; lower latency, more reliable message delivery
- Signal RPC connection management — automatic reconnect, structured error handling

### Changed

- Signal channel refactored to support both `json-rpc` (recommended) and `polling` modes, configured via `signal.mode` in config
- WhatsApp session stability improvements — reduced disconnection rate on long-running instances
